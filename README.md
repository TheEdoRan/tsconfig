# [@theedoran/tsconfig](https://github.com/theedoran/tsconfig)

> This package generates a sensible `TypeScript` configuration.

## Usage

```bash
npx @theedoran/tsconfig
```

The script will also ask you for project initialization (if `package.json` is not found) and `typescript` installation (if not already installed).

You can skip these questions with the `--no-questions` argument:

```bash
npx @theedoran/tsconfig --no-questions
```

_Done!_
